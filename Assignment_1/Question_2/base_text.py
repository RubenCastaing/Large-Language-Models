base_text = '''The Olympic Games, a global sporting spectacle, trace their roots back to ancient Greece. Originating as a
religious festival honouring Zeus, the god of sky and thunder, the ancient Olympics were held in Olympia
every four years from approximately 776 BC to 393 AD. Initially, the games consisted of a single footrace, but
over time expanded to include various athletic contests and cultural events. The Olympics served as a
unifying force among Greek city-states, even during periods of war, fostering a spirit of competition and
camaraderie.
However, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the Olympic Games fell into obscurity. It wasn't until the
late 19th century that the idea of reviving the Games emerged. Inspired by the ideals of Olympism, which
emphasized physical and moral education, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator, founded the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. His vision was to create a global sporting event that would
promote peace and understanding among nations.
The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, featuring a modest program of
sports. Over the years, the Games grew in scale and scope, with the inclusion of new sports and the
participation of athletes from an increasing number of countries. The Winter Olympic Games were added in
1924 to accommodate winter sports.
The Olympics have faced challenges and controversies throughout their history. The Games were cancelled
during both World Wars, and issues such as amateurism, doping, and political interference have marred
their reputation at times. Nevertheless, the Olympic spirit has endured, and the Games continue to be a
powerful symbol of international unity and competition.
Today, the Olympics are a mega-event, with thousands of athletes from around the world competing in a
wide range of sports. The Games have evolved into a global cultural phenomenon, with billions of people
tuning in to watch the world's best athletes compete. While the original ideals of Olympism may have been
diluted, the spirit of competition, excellence, and friendship remains at the heart of the Games.
The Olympics have come a long way since their humble beginnings in ancient Greece. From a local religious
festival to a global spectacle, the Games have shaped the course of history and continue to inspire athletes
and spectators alike.'''
